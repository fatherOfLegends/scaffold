Scaffold
========

An Android library designed to help you quickly create prototypes and production applications that follow the latest material
design guidelines.

For more information see [the website][4] or [the wiki][1].

Gradle
------

Scaffold is available via jcenter. It depends on several of the [Android support libraries][2]:

```
dependencies {
    ...


    def androidSupportLibVersion = "26.0.0";

    compile "com.lamcreations.scaffold:scaffold:${androidSupportLibVersion}"
    compile "com.android.support:support-core-utils:${androidSupportLibVersion}";
    compile "com.android.support:support-core-ui:${androidSupportLibVersion}";
    compile "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${androidSupportLibVersion}";
    compile "com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:${androidSupportLibVersion}";
    compile "com.android.support:preference-v7:${androidSupportLibVersion}";
    compile "com.android.support:design:${androidSupportLibVersion}";
    compile "com.android.support:support-annotations:${androidSupportLibVersion}";
}
```

Usage
-----
Scaffold is a collection of activities, fragments and views mostly designed to be extended. By using
